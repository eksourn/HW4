For part two I have included the jQuery validation plugin with several requirements for valid input such as ranges and invalid characters. I've also included the jQuery tabs and slider widgets. The sliders exhibits two-way binding between each slider and its corresponding text field and dynamically updates the multiplication table itself. The tabs save each new multiplication table in separate tabs.

WIP: Delete functionality for individual and multiple tabs are not working. Some of the row header values do not show but the multiplication table content does.
